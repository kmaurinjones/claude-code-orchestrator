## Core Success Criteria (IMMUTABLE)
1. **Create a simple Python hello world script**
   - Measurable: File `hello.py` exists in project root and prints "Hello, World!"
   - Non-negotiable: This validates the orchestrator can create files in the correct location

## Nice-to-Have (FLEXIBLE)
- None

## Out of Scope
- Complex functionality
- Multiple files

## Constraints (IMMUTABLE)
- Must use Python 3.12+
- File must be created in project root, NOT in .agentic/
