# 2025-10-28 Project Session

## Session Summary
- Extended the orchestrator feature set (v0.5.19–0.5.21): added operator NOTES.md integration, a script-runner/experiment logger workflow, reviewer timeout auto-retries with condensed prompts, and a CLI `--version` flag.
- Updated prompts and logging so every subagent/reviewer sees high-priority operator guidance and long-running jobs are captured in `.agentic/history/`.
- Verified the latest stock-price-tracker run after these upgrades; reviewer retries now succeed and the session automation produces deterministic logs.

## Next Session
- Implement the real OHLCV data-fetcher service (task-003) so the backend serves live price histories without placeholders.
- Wire the new experiment logger into training/evaluation scripts for the Bitcoin forecasting project and start capturing metrics per run.
- Continue the frontend/UX backlog (candlesticks, comparison mode, alerts) once real data is flowing.
- Monitor reviewer retry metrics and tune condensed prompts/turn limits if timeouts persist.
