# 2025-11-24 Project Session

## Session Summary

This session focused on refining orchestrator behavior and fixing several quality-of-life issues. Key accomplishments:

### Changelog Update Frequency Fix (v0.10.6 continuation)
- Changed changelog/docs update interval from task-count-based to step-based tracking
- Updates now occur only at: start (step 0), every 10th step (10, 20, 30...), and end of run
- Added `_last_flush_step` tracking and batch processing of changelog entries in `planner.py`
- Updated prompts in `context.py` and `reviewer.py` to explicitly instruct actors/reviewers NOT to update CHANGELOG.md manually

### Duplicate Print Statement Consolidation
- Identified redundant task selection prints (one from PLANNER, one from ORCHESTRATOR)
- Removed orchestrator-side print, enhanced planner print to include task ID
- Fixed resulting F841 lint error (unused variable `task`)

### Phantom Feedback Ingestion Fix
- Root-caused "Ingested 2 user feedback entries" appearing at start of every fresh run
- Issue: USER_NOTES.md template included real parseable example notes
- Fix: Changed examples to HTML comments so they're not parsed as actual feedback

### Version Bump
- Incremented to v0.10.7 and verified successful build/install

### Ongoing Workstreams
- 2 AGI paper example-projects running in background (continuing from previous work)

## Next Session

- **Verify fixes**: Run `orchestrate run` on a test project to confirm:
  - Changelog updates only at step 0, 10, 20, etc., and end
  - No phantom feedback ingestion on fresh runs
  - Single task selection print (from PLANNER only)
- **Monitor AGI paper runs**: Check results of the 2 example-projects currently executing
- **Consider**: Whether step-based interval for docs/changelog is the right abstraction, or if event-based (on task completion) would be more intuitive
- **Cleanup**: The venv has orphaned dist-info directories (0.12.1, 0.13.0) that could be cleaned up
